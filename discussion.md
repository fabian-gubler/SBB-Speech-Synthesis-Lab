# 4 Discussion

## 4.1 Recapitulation of Key Findings

Our work successfully demonstrated that the application of synthetic data augmentation can significantly enhance the performance of a Conformer-CTC model in automatic speech recognition tasks. Specifically, we observed a substantial reduction in the Word Error Rate (WER) compared to the baseline.

Notably, we discovered that a carefully balanced mix of human-recorded and synthetic data resulted in the optimal performance. The WER was minimized when our training set comprised 60% human-recorded samples and 40% synthetic samples.

## 4.2 Interpretation and Implications

The remarkable improvements in our model's performance, especially when trained with synthetic data featuring diverse accents, represent a significant breakthrough in overcoming the challenges posed by multi-accented and diverse speech. This finding could profoundly impact industries and applications where speech recognition technology is paramount, such as telecommunication services, assistive technologies, transcription services, and voice-activated systems, to name a few.

Additionally, our findings underscore the potential of synthetic data in mitigating the limitations of small or homogeneous datasets. This could be particularly beneficial in settings where data scarcity or privacy concerns restrict the availability of large, diverse datasets.

## 4.3 Comparison with Existing Literature

While our results align with previous research indicating the effectiveness of data augmentation in speech recognition tasks, our work further extends this understanding by demonstrating the added benefits of synthetic data. Specifically, we show that synthetic data can not only enlarge the training dataset but also improve its diversity, aiding the model in better generalizing to unseen, particularly accented, data.

## 4.4 Strengths and Limitations

Our research effectively highlights the potential of synthetic data augmentation in improving speech recognition performance. However, it is not without limitations. The primary limitation stems from the nature of our dataset. While synthetic data helps mitigate the lack of diversity in speaker voices and commands, the dataset would ideally be improved on the human-recorded side as well. This would provide a broader spectrum of natural speech variations and anomalies, thereby further enhancing the model's robustness and generalizability.

Additionally, while the Conformer-CTC model demonstrated impressive results with the limited data, it's possible that the model's performance might plateau or even deteriorate if trained on an excessively large or diverse dataset. Thus, a careful balance between dataset size, diversity, and model capacity needs to be maintained for optimal results.

## 4.5 Recommendations for Future Research

Given the promising results achieved through the incorporation of synthetic data, future research could explore several promising directions. One could examine the use of more sophisticated text-to-speech systems to generate even more realistic synthetic speech. Another avenue could involve introducing a second model that parses predictions with a limited classification set, potentially improving the overall system's performance.

Additional future work could focus on further diversifying the dataset, both on the human-recorded and synthetic sides. Techniques such as voice transformation (e.g., pitch alteration, speaker separation) could be applied to existing samples to generate more diverse training data. On the synthetic side, the performance of specific accents could be investigated to determine which contributed the most to the performance. This could then be compared to a test set that includes accented speakers, to explore whether using text-to-speech can help overcome the challenges posed by a heterogeneous workforce.

## 4.6 Conclusion

In conclusion, our research illustrates the transformative potential of synthetic data augmentation in advancing automatic speech recognition tasks. Despite the challenges of diverse accents and limited data, we demonstrated that it's possible to achieve significant improvements using an innovative data augmentation strategy. This provides a new perspective for speech recognition, suggesting that the intelligent use of synthetic samples can effectively mitigate the limitations

 of restricted datasets. Future research can build on these findings, further exploring and optimizing the use of synthetic data to enhance automatic speech recognition performance.
