Great! I have have successfully ran the experiments (now synthetic only with german samples,
later I will also run all the samples). Help me develop the first draft of the results
section. For this I will first provide you with the results. Secondly, I will provide you
with the notes that could help in developing this section. Also, I will provide figures
and added evaluation that could be relevant for this section. Your task is to help me
develop this section. If there are any additional results you need or clarification
questions before providing the final output please let me know beforehand. Please
clearly indicate in sections where I did not yet provide sufficient information or
context. Note that you should not develop the figures yet for the initial draft - only include placeholders and a short
description of what the figure should show.

# Results Notes

The results section serves to present the key findings of the project and primarily focuses on the performance comparison of the Conformer-CTC model under various training conditions. It delineates the model's performance when trained with different types and amounts of synthetic data, and how this compares to both the baseline model and the model trained only with human-recorded samples.

## Model Performance with Data Augmentation

This subsection provides a comprehensive analysis of how the inclusion of synthetic data in training impacted the model's performance. It begins by detailing the performance of the Conformer-CTC model at baseline (0-shot) and then explores the model's performance as synthetic data is incrementally added to the training set.

A table will be included to display the performance metrics at each step. This table will show the performance metrics for each increment of synthetic data added, allowing for easy comparison between the various levels of synthetic data inclusion.

## Comparison with Human-Recorded Samples

In this subsection, the performance of the model trained with synthetic data is compared against the model trained only with human-recorded samples. The discussion should outline how the use of synthetic data in training contributed to the improvement in model performance.

A comparative table can be included here to clearly show the difference in performance metrics between the models trained with and without synthetic data.

## Accent-Specific Performance

This part of the section delves into the impact of different accents on model performance. It discusses the model's proficiency in recognizing speech with diverse accents, focusing particularly on German accents and how the model performed when trained with German-accented synthetic samples.

A table detailing the performance of the model on various accents should be included here. This table can provide the performance metrics for each type of accent, highlighting the model's strengths and potential areas for improvement in accent recognition.

## Contributions of Synthetic Data

This subsection aims to pinpoint the specific aspects of the synthetic dataset that contributed most to the improvement in model performance. It analyzes the performance data to determine whether certain features of the synthetic data—such as particular accents or commandos—were especially beneficial.

## Qualitative Analysis

This subsection provides specific examples of the model's predictions to highlight its strengths and weaknesses. This can include instances where the model excelled or struggled in recognizing particular commandos or accents, providing a more qualitative perspective to complement the performance metrics.

By structuring the results section in this manner, it would be easier for you to plug in the specific results once they are available. You could then tailor the narrative in each subsection based on the actual findings.

# Discussion

## Recapitulation of Key Findings

Start this section by succinctly summarizing the primary outcomes of your experiments and results. Highlight the most significant findings, improvements over the baseline, the impacts of data augmentation, and the model's performance on different accents. 

For example:

--- Additional Information:

## Figures that could be include

- Table 1: A table comparing the Word Error Rate (WER) of the model at different stages: baseline (0 shot), training with human-recorded samples only, and various levels of synthetic data inclusion.
- Figure 7: A bar or line graph showing the change in performance (WER) as the amount of synthetic data used in training is increased. This would provide a visual representation of the trend.
- Figure 9: A confusion matrix to visually show where the model tends to make errors, in terms of predicting certain words incorrectly.
- Figure 10: An example of the model's prediction, with the original text, the predicted text, and highlighting errors, could serve as a case study to underline the strengths and weaknesses.

## Added Evaluation that could be included:

Quantiative Analysis:

- Confusion Matrix: This analysis could be useful to visualize the model's performance and understand which words are often confused with each other.

Qualitative Analysis:

- Manual Error Analysis: You could manually review a subset of the transcriptions to understand the nature of the errors made by the model. This could be insightful, especially when the model makes mistakes that are not captured by the metrics.

- Case Studies: You could present specific examples where the model performed exceptionally well or poorly. This could provide more context to the quantitative results and make the findings more tangible. This includes looking at specific foreign accents.
